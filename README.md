HDLC stads for High-Level Data Link Control. This library adapts the HDLC
protocol for standard serial, allowing easy communication with CRC error
detection among microcontrollers connected via a serial bus.

For more information about HDLC and take a look at 
[RFC-1662 - PPP in HDLC-like Framing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1662)
or in the doc/rfc1662.txt file.

Implemented as a C++ class, the HDLC Data Link Layer can be extended using class
inheritance. The library also provides an One Byte Transport Layer derived class
as an extension example.

You can use HDLC both for closed- and open-source projects. You are also
free to keep changes to this library to yourself. However we'll enjoy your
improvements and suggestions. `:-)`

## Supported hardware

The project has been developed and tested with AVR microcontroller family
(ATmega 2560) using [Arduinutil](https://github.com/djboni/arduinutil) as
development platform.

However it should be very easy to port to another microcontroller family and
development platform.


## How to use HDLC

* Create an HDLC object
* Send data with HDLC
* Receive data with HDLC

```cpp
#include "HDLC.h"
HDLC hdlc;

void hdlc_sendMsg() {
  uint8_t msg[] = "Hello world!";
  hdlc.transmitBlock(msg, sizeof(msg));
}

void hdlc_receiveMsg() {
  while(hdlc.receive() == 0U) {}
  uint8_t buff[hdlc.RXBFLEN];
  uint16_t size = hdlc.copyReceivedMessage(buff);
  Serial_print("Msg[%u]=%s\n", size, buff);
}
```
